# stb-c3

Uhh this is an incomplete attempt to bind all the stb libraries to C3.

I've made bindings for image, image_write and image_resize2 and then I got bored and stopped.
There's an example showing how you use them with raylib in `src/main.c3`

Anyway, I'm publishing this in case someone in the future wants to take off from here.
